For the final project i would like to create visualizations on worldwide active cases and daily death reports on COVID-19.

## The Data source is located here:- https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

The dataset is produced by  Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University.
The timeseries folder contains daily time series summary tables, including confirmed, deaths and recovered.
The csse_covid_19_daily_reports folder has daily case reports.
The csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us folder contains an aggregation of each USA State level data.

## Some data parameters are:-
Geography, Confirmed Deaths, Confirmed Recoveries and Active cases.

The R packages i plan on using are https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus to download the dataset.

First step would be clean up the data for nulls or missing information.
Some of the visualizations i plan on making are:-
A Timeseries plot of all the confirmed cases by countries.
A barplot os US States with confirmed deaths.
Spread of Covid over time since December 2019.
A Heat Map of the world to show the confirmed cases across globe.

I Believe this analysis important as the COVID is currently world's most active problem to analyse.
By this analysis we can which countries are affected the most and where the most vaccines may be required when it becomes available for public.
We could also be able to see which countries have been able to to bring down the spread of the virus and have been effective.
I plan on shifting my focus to US states after above is achieved.
There is much more analysis we can do once the data is plotted like the most active cases in US States and many other granular analysis.
